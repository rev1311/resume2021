                    I am an OG nerd. I got my first PC at 12, and have lived online ever since. I took that computer apart, and *ALMOST* put it back together. Since then, I have built every rig I have owned. This is also how I first began learning web development, by deconstructing sites I liked.

                    When I am not building or researching code, me and my dog, Zero, take road trips to camp in my Jeep around Northern California and Oregon. I love audible, video games, sci-fi, dogs, and the great outdoors.

                    Raised in Tennessee, I moved to California for work in the printing industry, making wine labels. My love of computers helped me transition into a prepress position (Illustrator/Photoshop), where I learned graphic design by decontructing some amazing designs. This led me to design wine labels as a side hustle.

                    <br />
                    <p>
                    Always seeking to learn more landed me in leadership positions due to my accumulated knowledge of print, design, and the ability to communicate effectively with those around me.

                    Being passionate about programming, I spent my free time learning React and Javascript. I decided to attend a coding bootcamp at the University of California Berkeley, while still working full-time. The schedule was not pleasant, but nothing worth having is easy.

                    <p>
                    I have since left my career in the print industry to persue a career in tech. I am looking for the opportunity to learn more, build, and grow.

                    I spend my time learning React and Javascript. I am an Audible/podcast junkie. I take my dog on road trips to camp in my jeep. I spend too much time playing videogames and watching sci-fi.
