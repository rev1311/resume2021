                    I am an OG nerd. I got my first PC at 12, and have lived online ever since. I took that computer apart, and *ALMOST* put it back together. Since then, I have built every rig I have owned. This is also how I first began learning web development, by deconstructing sites I liked.

                    <p>
                    When I am not building or researching code, me and my dog, Zero, take road trips to camp in my Jeep around Northern California and Oregon. I love audible, video games, sci-fi, dogs, and the great outdoors. 
                    </p>

                    Raised in Tennessee, I moved to California for work in the printing industry, making wine labels. My love of computers helped me transition into a prepress position (Illustrator/Photoshop), where I learned graphic design by decontructing some amazing designs. This led me to design wine labels as a side hustle. 
                    </p>
                    <br />
                    <p>
                    Always seeking to learn more landed me in leadership positions due to my accumulated knowledge of print, design, and the ability to communicate effectively with those around me. 
                    </p>
                    <br />
                    <p>
                    Being passionate about programming, I spent my free time learning React and Javascript. I decided to attend a coding bootcamp at the University of California Berkeley, while still working full-time. The schedule was not pleasant, but nothing worth having is easy. 
                    </p>
                    <br />
                    <p>
                    I have since left my career in the print industry to persue a career in tech. I am looking for the opportunity to learn more, build, and grow.
